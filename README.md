# Weather Dashboard

A Python-based desktop application built with Tkinter to display real-time weather data and a 5-day temperature forecast for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It includes an auto-location feature via IP geolocation and a clean, responsive UI.

## Features

- **Current Weather**: Displays temperature, humidity, weather description, and an icon.
- **5-Day Forecast**: Visualizes daily noon temperatures in a Matplotlib chart.
- **City Search**: Input any city name to fetch its weather data.
- **Auto Location**: Detects user's city based on IP and loads weather automatically.
- **Responsive Design**: Weather icon scales with window size.
- **Error Handling**: Shows user-friendly messages for API or network issues.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required packages (listed in `requirements.txt`):
  - `requests` (for API requests)
  - `Pillow` (for image processing)
  - `matplotlib` (for forecast charts)
  - `tkinter` (included with Python for GUI)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository/script.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```
   python weather_dashboard.py
   ```

   (Replace `weather_dashboard.py` with your script's filename.)

2. On launch, the app auto-detects your city and displays its weather.

3. To search manually:

   - Enter a city (e.g., "Tokyo") in the input field and click "üîç Search".
   - Click "üìç Auto" to refresh weather for your detected location.

4. Resize the window to adjust the weather icon dynamically.

5. The forecast chart plots temperatures at local noon for the next 5 days.

## API Usage

- **Weather Data**: Fetched from `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`.
- **Forecast Data**: Uses `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast` (3-hour data, filtered to noon).
- **Location**: Uses `https://ipinfo.io/json` for IP-based city detection (no key required).
- **Icons**: Retrieved from OpenWeatherMap's icon server.

Note: API calls include timeouts for reliability. The free OpenWeatherMap plan limits to 60 calls/minute.

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid API Key**: Verify your OpenWeatherMap key is correct and active.
- **Network Issues**: Check your internet; errors are displayed in pop-ups.
- **Empty Forecast**: Retry if the API returns no data (rare).
- **Chart Issues**: Ensure `matplotlib` is installed (`pip install matplotlib`).
- **Location Failure**: Use manual city entry if auto-detection fails.

## Limitations

- Supports only metric units (¬∞C).
- Forecast selects the 3-hour data point closest to local noon.
- Icon resizing avoids excessive API calls, so it may not update on every resize.
- Tested on Python 3.12 across Windows, macOS, and Linux; Tkinter behavior may vary.
